# ImageProcessing_Map

It is a very simple application designed to show the rainfall distribution for different states with real-time tracking of it .

It provides a user with a real time map of our country where the user can just traverse through various states and can get to know about the rainfall distribution.

This system can be used for any kind of real-time state wise display applications.

I have also attached a simple gif which shows how the project is intended to work.

The values added a Random, it is not necessary to implement the display system with rainfall only based upon the requirement of the project the values can change.

Libraries Required:-

1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. OpenCV
